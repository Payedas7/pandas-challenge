•	Only 1 of the 6 most popular items appear in the list of the 18 lowest priced items/items prices in the bottom 10% of item prices. (See Popular Items and Other Analysis - Lowest Priced)

•	Males not only the make up over 80% of the players of this game, they are also responsible for over 80% of the revenue. (See Gender Demographics and Other Analysis - Gender Purchase Totals)

•	Out of the 573 players, each player has spent under 20 dollars on items.

•	The 20-24 age bracket spends has generated more revenue than any other bracket, but the 25-29 age group, on average, purchases more expensive items.

•	The Retribution Axe not only appears in the most popular item list, it is priced almost 2 dollars more than other popular items on that list and is the item that has generated the most revenue.

•	Other than the Retribution Axe, the most popular items list generates items that are priced below the average purchase price.

Using Python Pandas, I analyzed the game Heroes of Pymoli and provide Purchasing Analysis, Gender and Age Demographics, Top Spenders, Most Profitable and Most Popular items purchased.
OBSERVED TRENDS:

1) Over 80% of all players are males. Males made the majority of purchases and contributed to over 80% of the total revenue.

2) Regardless of gender, 20-24 year olds have made the most number of purchases and spent the most on this game.

3) The most profitable items all had high item prices. Despite this, multiple purchases were made for these items.
